This is a scoring app for a disc golf game called Wolf.
It works best with 4 or 5 players.
It's a modified team game where one of the players on each hole picks a partner after the tee shot and they play against the other players for that hole.
The app is designed to work without internet connect once loaded so that you can continue using it on a course with poor reception.
